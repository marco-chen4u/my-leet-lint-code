* LintCode 622. Frog Jump
A frog is crossing the river, the river is divided into units, 
and each unit may exist or not exist a stone. 
The frog can jump on the stone, but it must not jump into the water.

Given a list of stones' position(in units) in sorted ascending order, 
determind if the frog is able to cross the river by landing the last stone. 

Initially, the frog is on the first position and the first jump must be 1 unit.
If the frog's last jump was k unit, 
then its next jump must be either k -1, k, or k + 1 units. 

Note that frog can only jump in forward direction.

Example 1
    Given stones = [0,1,3,5,6,8,12,17]
    Input:
        [0,1,3,5,6,8,12,17]
    Output:
        true
    Explanation:
        There are a total of 8 stones.
        The first stone at the 0th unit, 
	second stone at the 1st unit,
        third stone at the 3rd unit, and so on...
	The last stone at the 17th unit.
        Return true. 
	The frog can jump to the last stone by 
        jumping 1 unit to the 2nd stone, 
	then 2 units to the 3rd stone, 
	then 2 units to the 4th stone, 
        then 3 units to the 6th stone, 
	4 units to the 7th stone, 
        and 5 units to the 8th stone.

Example 2
    Given stones = `[0,1,2,3,4,8,9,11]`
    Input:
        [0,1,2,3,4,8,9,11]
    Output:
        false
    Explanation:
        Return false. 
	There is no way to jump to the last stone as the gap between the 5th and 6th stone is too large.

Notice
    -The number of stones is â‰¥ 2 and is < 1100.
    -Each stone's position will be a non-negative integer < 2^31.
    -The first stone's position is always 0.
